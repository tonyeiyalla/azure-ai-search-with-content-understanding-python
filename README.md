# Azure AI Search with Content Understanding Samples (Python)

Welcome! Content Understanding is an innovative solution designed to analyze and interpret diverse media types, including documents, images, audio, and video. It transforms this content into structured, organized, and searchable data. In this sample, we will demonstrate how to index your files using the rich insights extracted from the Content Understanding API, and subsequently index these files with Azure Search to enhance their searchability.


- The samples in this repository default to the latest preview API version: **(2024-12-01-preview)**.


## Samples

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [search_with_document_layout.ipynb](notebooks/search_with_document_layout.ipynb) | Use content understanding Layout for content extraction from Documents, and index the file in Azure search |
| [search_with_visual_document.ipynb](notebooks/search_with_visual_document.ipynb) | Extract custom fields with content understanding API, and used it to index the file in Azure search |
| [search_with_video.ipynb](notebooks/search_with_video.ipynb) | Extract custom fields with content understanding API, and used it to index the file in Azure search |


## Getting started
### GitHub Codespaces
You can run this repo virtually by using GitHub Codespaces, which will open a web-based VS Code in your browser.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?skip_quickstart=true&machine=basicLinux32gb&repo=901183239&ref=main&geo=UsEast&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fdevcontainer.json)

### Local environment

1. Make sure the following tools are installed:

    * [Azure Developer CLI (azd)](https://aka.ms/install-azd)
    * [Python 3.11+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Make a new directory called `azure-ai-search-with-content-understanding-python` and clone this template into it using the `azd` CLI:

    ```shell
    azd init -t azure-ai-search-with-content-understanding-python
    ```

    You can also use git to clone the repository if you prefer.

## Configure Azure AI service resource
### (Option 1) Use `azd` commands to auto create temporal resources to run sample
1. Make sure you have permission to grant roles under subscription
1. Login Azure
    ```shell
    azd auth login
    ```
1. Setting up environment, following prompts to choose location
    ```shell
    azd up
    ```


### (Option 2) Manually create resources and set environment variables
1. Create [Azure AI Services resource](docs/create_azure_ai_service.md)
1. Go to `Access Control (IAM)` in resource, grant yourself role `Cognitive Services User`
1. Create [Azure OpenAI resource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal)
1. Deploy GPT model
1. Deploy embedding model
1. Go to `Access Control (IAM)` in resource, grant yourself role `Cognitive Services OpenAI User`
1. Create [Azure Search resource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-create-service-portal)
1. Go to `Access Control (IAM)` in resource, grant yourself role `Search Index Data Contributor`
1. Go to `Access Control (IAM)` in resource, grant yourself role `Search Service Contributor`
1. Copy `notebooks/.env.sample` to `notebooks/.env`
1. Fill required information into .env from the resources you created
1. Login Azure
   ```shell
   az login
   ```

## Open a Jupyter notebook and follow the step-by-step guidance

Navigate to the `notebooks` directory and select the sample notebook you are interested in. Since Codespaces is pre-configured with the necessary environment, you can directly execute each step in the notebook.
